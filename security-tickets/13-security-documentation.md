# Add Security Documentation

## Priority: 4 (Low - Enhancement)
## Estimated Time: 4-6 hours
## Phase: Month 3 - Ongoing Security

## Description
Create comprehensive security documentation including SECURITY.md, incident response procedures, security architecture diagrams, and vulnerability reporting process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SECURITY.md created with vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Security architecture diagram added
- [ ] Incident response playbook documented
- [ ] Threat model documented
- [ ] Security checklist for deployments
- [ ] Compliance documentation (if needed)

## Technical Implementation Details

**SECURITY.md:**
```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@yourdomain.com

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge within 48 hours and provide a timeline for fixes.

## Security Measures

- All services behind Traefik reverse proxy with rate limiting
- Multi-factor authentication via Authelia
- Automated vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
- Encrypted backups with Restic
- Network segmentation (3-tier architecture)
- Certificate monitoring and auto-renewal
- Centralized logging with Loki
- Security headers enforced
- Regular security audits

## Incident Response

See [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) for detailed procedures.

Quick response steps:
1. Isolate affected services
2. Review logs for IOCs
3. Notify security team
4. Contain and remediate
5. Document and learn
```

**docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md:**
```markdown
# Incident Response Playbook

## Phase 1: Detection
- Monitor alerts in #security-alerts Slack channel
- Check Grafana dashboards for anomalies
- Review Loki logs for suspicious patterns

## Phase 2: Containment
```bash
# Isolate compromised container
docker network disconnect homeserver_frontend <container>

# Stop container if necessary
docker stop <container>

# Snapshot current state
docker commit <container> incident-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Phase 3: Investigation
- Extract logs: `docker logs <container> > incident-logs.txt`
- Review authentication logs in Authelia
- Check file integrity changes
- Analyze network connections

## Phase 4: Eradication
- Remove malicious code/containers
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Update credentials
- Rebuild from clean images

## Phase 5: Recovery
- Restore from backups if needed
- Bring services back online gradually
- Monitor for reinfection

## Phase 6: Lessons Learned
- Document timeline
- Update security measures
- Share findings with team
```

**docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md:**
```markdown
# Security Architecture

## Defense in Depth Layers

1. **Network Perimeter**
   - Reverse proxy (Traefik)
   - Rate limiting
   - DDoS protection (Cloudflare)

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Authelia with MFA
   - OAuth2 integration
   - Session management

3. **Application Security**
   - Container isolation
   - Resource limits
   - Security profiles (seccomp)

4. **Data Security**
   - Encrypted backups
   - TLS everywhere
   - Secrets management

5. **Monitoring & Detection**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Loki logs
   - AlertManager notifications

## Threat Model

See threat model diagram and analysis in this document.
```

## Files to Create
1. `SECURITY.md` - Root level security policy
2. `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` - IR playbook
3. `docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture docs
4. `docs/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment checklist
5. `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` - Threat analysis

## Success Metrics
- Security documentation complete and accessible
- Team trained on incident response
- Vulnerability reporting process working
- Security checklist used for deployments
