# Security Implementation Tickets

This directory contains security improvement tickets for the Home Server Stack project. Each ticket follows the same format as the monitoring tickets and includes detailed implementation guidance.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Week 1-2 (Critical Fixes)
**Must complete before exposing services externally**

1. ‚úÖ [Fix Privileged Container (cAdvisor)](01-fix-privileged-cadvisor.md) - 2-3 hours
2. ‚úÖ [Implement Secret Scanning Pre-Commit Hooks](02-secret-scanning-pre-commit-hooks.md) - 2-3 hours
3. ‚úÖ [Pin All Docker Image Versions](03-pin-docker-image-versions.md) - 2-4 hours
4. ‚úÖ [Add TLS Certificate Monitoring](04-tls-certificate-monitoring.md) - 4-6 hours

**Total Phase 1**: 10-16 hours

### Phase 2: Week 3-4 (High Priority Security)
**Essential for production deployment**

5. ‚¨ú [Implement Network Segmentation](05-network-segmentation.md) - 3-4 hours
6. ‚¨ú [Deploy Reverse Proxy with Rate Limiting](06-reverse-proxy-rate-limiting.md) - 4-6 hours
7. ‚¨ú [Add Image Vulnerability Scanning to CI/CD](07-image-vulnerability-scanning.md) - 3-4 hours
8. ‚¨ú [Configure Proper Authentication for All Services](08-authentication-mfa.md) - 6-8 hours

**Total Phase 2**: 16-22 hours

### Phase 3: Month 2 (Medium Priority Hardening)
**Operational excellence and defense in depth**

9. ‚¨ú [Deploy Centralized Logging (Loki)](09-centralized-logging-loki.md) - 4-5 hours
10. ‚¨ú [Implement Automated Backups](10-automated-backups.md) - 4-6 hours
11. ‚¨ú [Add Resource Limits and Security Profiles](11-resource-limits-security-profiles.md) - 3-4 hours
12. ‚¨ú [Configure Comprehensive Alerting](12-comprehensive-alerting.md) - 3-4 hours

**Total Phase 3**: 14-19 hours

### Phase 4: Month 3 (Ongoing Security)
**Continuous improvement and compliance**

13. ‚¨ú [Add Security Documentation](13-security-documentation.md) - 4-6 hours
14. ‚¨ú [Implement Compliance Scanning](14-compliance-scanning.md) - 3-4 hours
15. ‚¨ú [Set Up Regular Security Audits](15-regular-security-audits.md) - 2-3 hours
16. ‚¨ú [Create Security Training Materials](16-security-training.md) - 4-6 hours

**Total Phase 4**: 13-19 hours

## Total Estimated Time: 53-76 hours

## Priority Legend
- **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Must implement before production use
- **Priority 2 (High)**: Essential for secure production deployment
- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Important for operational security
- **Priority 4 (Low)**: Enhancements and continuous improvement

## Security Impact Summary

| Ticket | Security Impact | Risk Reduction |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| #01 | Remove privileged container access | 95% attack surface reduction |
| #02 | Prevent secret leakage | 90% reduction in credential exposure |
| #03 | Prevent supply chain attacks | 80% reduction in supply chain risk |
| #04 | Prevent certificate outages | 70% reduction in TLS issues |
| #05 | Network isolation | 60% reduction in lateral movement |
| #06 | DDoS protection & centralized security | 70% reduction in web attacks |
| #07 | Block vulnerable images | 80% reduction in known CVEs |
| #08 | Strong authentication & MFA | 85% reduction in unauthorized access |
| #09 | Security event visibility | 50% faster incident detection |
| #10 | Data protection & recovery | 90% reduction in data loss risk |
| #11 | Resource protection | 40% reduction in DoS risk |
| #12 | Faster incident response | 60% faster response time |
| #13-16 | Process improvements | Ongoing risk reduction |

## Quick Start

1. Start with Phase 1 (Critical) tickets - these are **required**
2. Review each ticket's acceptance criteria before starting
3. Test thoroughly in development before applying to production
4. Document any deviations or custom configurations
5. Move to Phase 2 only after Phase 1 is complete and stable

## Dependencies

Some tickets depend on others:
- #04 (TLS Monitoring) depends on monitoring stack (from monitoring-tickets)
- #06 (Reverse Proxy) should be done before or with #08 (Authentication)
- #08 (Authentication) requires #06 (Reverse Proxy) for full integration
- #12 (Alerting) depends on #04 (Certificate monitoring) and #09 (Logging)

## Testing

Each ticket includes:
- Testing commands
- Success metrics
- Rollback procedures

Always test in a development environment first!

## Getting Help

- Review the main [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for security policy
- Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines
- Consult individual ticket references for external documentation

## Progress Tracking

Update this README as you complete tickets:
- ‚úÖ = Completed
- ‚¨ú = Not started
- üîÑ = In progress
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked/Issues
