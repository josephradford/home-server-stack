3. **[03-critical-alerting-rules.md](03-critical-alerting-rules.md)**
   - Implement critical alerts for service down and resource exhaustion
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Service-Specific Monitoring (Week 2) - Priority 2 (High)
**Goal**: Implement detailed monitoring for each service

4. **[04-adguard-monitoring.md](04-adguard-monitoring.md)**
   - DNS query metrics, blocked requests tracking, performance monitoring
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

5. **[05-n8n-workflow-monitoring.md](05-n8n-workflow-monitoring.md)**
   - Workflow execution tracking, success/failure rates, error monitoring
   - Estimated time: 4-5 hours

6. **[06-ollama-ai-monitoring.md](06-ollama-ai-monitoring.md)**
   - AI model availability, inference performance, resource utilization
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Enhanced Observability (Week 3) - Priority 3 (Medium)
**Goal**: Add comprehensive logging and external monitoring

7. **[07-log-aggregation-loki.md](07-log-aggregation-loki.md)**
   - Centralized logging with Loki and Promtail, log-based alerting
   - Estimated time: 4-5 hours

8. **[08-blackbox-monitoring.md](08-blackbox-monitoring.md)**
   - External endpoint monitoring, SSL certificate tracking, health checks
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

### Phase 4: Optimization & Documentation (Week 4) - Priority 4 (Low)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and create operational documentation

9. **[09-performance-optimization.md](09-performance-optimization.md)**
   - Tune retention policies, optimize queries, implement resource limits
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

10. **[10-documentation-runbooks.md](10-documentation-runbooks.md)**
    - Create runbooks, troubleshooting guides, backup procedures
    - Estimated time: 4-5 hours

## Total Implementation Effort
- **Total Tickets**: 10
- **Estimated Time**: 33-42 hours
- **Implementation Period**: 4 weeks
- **Resource Requirements**: 2-3 GB additional RAM, 50-100 GB storage

## Quick Start Implementation Order

For fastest value delivery, implement in this order:
1. Tickets 1-3 (Foundation) - Critical monitoring baseline
2. Ticket 4 (AdGuard) - Most critical service monitoring
3. Tickets 2 & 8 (Dashboards & Blackbox) - Immediate visibility
4. Remaining tickets based on priority and available time

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Sufficient system resources (see individual tickets)
- Basic understanding of Prometheus/Grafana concepts
- Access to modify docker-compose configuration

## Environment Variables Required
Create or update your `.env` file with:
```bash
# Monitoring Configuration
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=your_secure_grafana_password
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
ALERT_EMAIL_USER=alerts@your-domain.com
ALERT_EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=admin@your-domain.com

# Service Credentials (for monitoring)
ADGUARD_USER=admin
ADGUARD_PASS=your_adguard_password
```

## Usage Instructions

### Creating GitHub Issues
1. Copy the content from each markdown file
2. Create a new GitHub issue
3. Use the filename (without .md) as the issue title
4. Paste the content as the issue description
5. Apply appropriate labels (priority, component, etc.)

### Implementation Workflow
1. Assign tickets to milestones (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
2. Implement tickets in phase order
3. Test each component after implementation
4. Update documentation as you progress
5. Mark tickets as complete after validation

### Validation Checklist
After implementing each ticket:
- [ ] Services are running and healthy
- [ ] Metrics are being collected
- [ ] Dashboards display data correctly
- [ ] Alerts can fire and clear properly
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Support and Troubleshooting
- Check individual ticket documentation for specific issues
- Review logs with `docker logs <service_name>`
- Verify configuration with `docker compose config`
- Test connectivity between services
- Refer to troubleshooting guides in documentation tickets

## Future Enhancements
Consider these additional improvements after core implementation:
- Multi-site monitoring for redundancy
- Advanced analytics and machine learning alerts
- Integration with external monitoring services
- Custom business metrics and SLAs
- Mobile dashboard applications
- Advanced log analysis and correlation
