- Transport NSW rate limited to 30 req/min
- Apple Health sync not instant (up to 30 min delay)
- iOS location requires "Always" permission

### Functional
- No authentication on Homepage (use VPN/firewall)
- Home Assistant requires separate login
- Habitica requires separate login
- Traffic limited to TomTom coverage area
- Transport limited to NSW

### By Design
- Fitness automation requires iOS devices
- Location tracking requires iOS Companion App
- Some widgets require specific API keys
- Self-hosted means you maintain it

## FAQ

**Q: Can I skip Home Assistant?**
A: Not recommended. You'll lose location tracking, Habitica integration, and fitness automation. Homepage can work without it, but many features depend on HA.

**Q: Can I use cloud Habitica instead of self-hosted?**
A: Yes! Just use `https://habitica.com` as the URL. Self-hosted gives you more control and privacy.

**Q: Do I need iOS devices?**
A: No, but Ticket 09 features (location/fitness) require them. Android has similar capabilities but different setup.

**Q: Can I add more family members later?**
A: Yes! Just install HA iOS app on their devices and add them as people in HA.

**Q: What if I don't have an Apple Watch?**
A: Fitness automations won't work, but everything else will. You can still manually complete Habitica tasks.

**Q: Can I customize the dashboard colors/theme?**
A: Yes! Edit `data/homepage/config/settings.yaml` - many themes and colors available.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: Just server electricity and optional Health Auto Export ($3.99). All other software is free/open source.

**Q: Can I access this from outside my home?**
A: Yes, but requires VPN or reverse proxy with authentication. Not covered in these tickets for security reasons.
