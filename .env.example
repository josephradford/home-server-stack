# BOM Weather (Australian Bureau of Meteorology)
# Location search by suburb name
# Uses the weather-au library which accesses BOM's official API
# Provides comprehensive weather data:
#   - Current observations (temp, feels like, wind, rain, humidity)
#   - 7-day daily forecast (temps, rain, UV, sunrise/sunset, fire danger)
#   - 16x 3-hourly forecast (detailed hourly conditions)
#   - Next rain forecast
#
# Examples: "parramatta", "sydney", "melbourne", "brisbane"
# The API will find the best matching location and nearest observation station automatically

# PUID: Your user ID (run `id -u` to get this)
# Default: 1000 (first non-root user on most Linux systems)

# PGID: IMPORTANT - Must match docker group GID for container stats to work
# Run `getent group docker | cut -d: -f3` to get the docker group GID on your system
# On most Linux systems this is NOT 1000 (typically 999, 998, 994, or similar)
# If Homepage shows "unknown" status for containers, this is likely the issue

# ❌ Embed URL: .../calendar/embed?src=...
# ❌ Public URL without private token: .../public/basic.ics (only works if calendar is public)

#
# To get the correct URL:
# 1. Open Google Calendar > Click 3 dots next to your calendar > Settings and sharing
# 2. Scroll to "Integrate calendar" section
