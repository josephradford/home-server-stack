## üìã Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd home-server-stack

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Update SERVER_IP, TIMEZONE, passwords

# 3. Run first-time setup (includes all services + monitoring)
# SSL certificates are automatically generated
make setup

# 4. Configure Bookwyrm (one-time)
cd external/bookwyrm-docker
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Configure Bookwyrm settings

# 5. Deploy Bookwyrm
make bookwyrm-setup
```

**Note:**
- SSL certificates for n8n are automatically generated during `make setup`
- To regenerate with a custom domain: `make regenerate-ssl DOMAIN=your-domain.com`
- The first `make setup` will deploy all core services and monitoring, and clone the Bookwyrm wrapper
- Configure and deploy Bookwyrm separately using `make bookwyrm-setup`

**Using the Makefile:**
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make setup` - First time setup (all services + monitoring)
- `make bookwyrm-setup` - Deploy Bookwyrm (after configuring .env)
- `make update` - Update all services to latest versions
- `make start` - Start all services
- `make stop` - Stop all services
- `make logs` - View logs from all services
- See `make help` for complete list of commands

- AdGuard Home: `http://SERVER_IP:80`
- n8n: `https://SERVER_IP:5678`
- Ollama API: `http://SERVER_IP:11434`
- Habitica: `http://SERVER_IP:8080`
