A complete self-hosted infrastructure for home automation, AI, and network services using Docker Compose.

  - **System Overview** - CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
  - **Container Health** - Docker container status and resource usage
  - **Resource Utilization** - Historical trends and capacity planning
- **[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **[Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)** - Alert routing and management

See [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for the complete catalog including planned services.

## 📋 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd home-server-stack

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Update SERVER_IP, TIMEZONE, passwords

# 3. Run first-time setup (includes all services + monitoring)
make setup
```

**Note:** `make setup` will optionally prompt you to configure Let's Encrypt SSL certificates if your `.env` includes `DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, and `GANDIV5_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Otherwise, services use self-signed certificates (browser warnings expected).

**Using the Makefile:**
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make setup` - First time setup (all services + monitoring)
- `make update` - Update all services to latest versions
- `make start` - Start all services
- `make stop` - Stop all services
- `make logs` - View logs from all services
- See `make help` for complete list of commands

**Access Services:**

All services are accessible via domain names on your local network:

- **Traefik Dashboard:** `https://traefik.${DOMAIN}`
- **AdGuard Home:** `https://adguard.${DOMAIN}` (DNS admin)
- **n8n:** `https://n8n.${DOMAIN}` (Workflow automation)
- **Grafana:** `https://grafana.${DOMAIN}` (Monitoring)
- **Prometheus:** `https://prometheus.${DOMAIN}` (Metrics)
- **Alertmanager:** `https://alerts.${DOMAIN}` (Alerts)

**OpenClaw AI Assistant** (Native installation - not Docker):
- Install with: `make openclaw-install` (run on server, not dev machine)
- Web UI: `http://${SERVER_IP}:18789`
- Access via Telegram bot
- See `make help` for OpenClaw commands

**Note:** Services are accessible via domain names thanks to Traefik reverse proxy and AdGuard Home DNS. Your devices must use AdGuard Home as their DNS server (configured automatically if DHCP points to the server).

**Direct Access (Emergency/Operational):** Some services expose direct ports for specific use cases:
- AdGuard Home: `http://SERVER_IP:8888` (emergency access if Traefik fails)
- OpenClaw: `http://SERVER_IP:18789` (web UI - native installation)
- Prometheus: `http://SERVER_IP:9090` (metrics scraping)
- Alertmanager: `http://SERVER_IP:9093` (alert routing)

These are not intended for regular use - domain-based access via Traefik is recommended. See [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for complete list.

## 📚 Documentation

**Primary documentation:**
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Complete operational guide (setup, configuration, operations, troubleshooting)
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture and visual diagrams
- **[SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md)** - Service catalog with access details

All operational knowledge is consolidated in CLAUDE.md which covers:
- Initial setup and configuration
- Service management and operations
- SSL certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Architecture and design decisions

## 🔐 Security

This project implements **multi-layered defense-in-depth security** with four protection layers:

### Security Layers

**🔥 Layer 1: Network Firewall (UFW)**
- Default deny incoming, SSH rate-limited
- Only WireGuard VPN (51820/UDP) and HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) exposed
- Local network and VPN clients have full access

**🛡️ Layer 2: Traefik Middleware**
- **IP Whitelisting**: Admin interfaces only accessible from local network/VPN
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, XSS protection, frame deny
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 req/min for admin, 100 req/min for webhooks

**🚫 Layer 3: Fail2ban**
- Auto-bans IPs after repeated auth failures (3 → 1h ban)
- Detects scanning activity (10 x 404 → 24h ban)
- Monitors webhook abuse (20 x rate limit → 10m ban)

**📊 Layer 4: Prometheus Security Monitoring**
- Real-time alerts for auth failures, scanning, DDoS attempts
- Tracks rate limit enforcement and server errors
- Monitors fail2ban and Traefik availability

### Access Model

- **Admin Interfaces** (n8n, Grafana, etc.): VPN or local network only
- **Future Webhooks**: Public access with rate limiting (not yet configured)
- **VPN Primary Boundary**: WireGuard for all remote admin access

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for security policy and **[security-tickets/README.md](security-tickets/README.md)** for the complete security roadmap.
