# Home Server Stack

A complete self-hosted infrastructure for home automation, AI, and network services using Docker Compose.

## üöÄ Services

**Core Services:**
- **[AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome)** - Network-wide ad blocking and DNS server
- **[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)** - Workflow automation platform
- **[WireGuard](https://github.com/wireguard)** - VPN for secure remote access
- **[Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)** - Reverse proxy for domain-based service access

**Monitoring Stack:**
- **[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)** - Metrics visualization and dashboards
- **[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **[Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)** - Alert routing and management
- **[Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)** - System metrics exporter
- **[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)** - Container metrics

See [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for the complete catalog including planned services.

## üìã Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd home-server-stack

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Update SERVER_IP, TIMEZONE, passwords

# 3. Run first-time setup (includes all services + monitoring)
make setup
```

**Note:** `make setup` will optionally prompt you to configure Let's Encrypt SSL certificates if your `.env` includes `DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, and `GANDIV5_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Otherwise, services use self-signed certificates (browser warnings expected).

**Using the Makefile:**
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make setup` - First time setup (all services + monitoring)
- `make update` - Update all services to latest versions
- `make start` - Start all services
- `make stop` - Stop all services
- `make logs` - View logs from all services
- See `make help` for complete list of commands

**Access Services:**

All services are accessible via domain names on your local network:

- **Traefik Dashboard:** `https://traefik.home.local`
- **AdGuard Home:** `https://adguard.home.local` (DNS admin)
- **n8n:** `https://n8n.home.local` (Workflow automation)
- **Grafana:** `https://grafana.home.local` (Monitoring)
- **Prometheus:** `https://prometheus.home.local` (Metrics)
- **Alertmanager:** `https://alerts.home.local` (Alerts)

**Note:** Services are accessible via domain names thanks to Traefik reverse proxy and AdGuard Home DNS. Your devices must use AdGuard Home as their DNS server (configured automatically if DHCP points to the server).

**Direct IP Access:** Some services remain accessible via IP:port for specific operational needs:
- AdGuard Home: `http://SERVER_IP:8888` (emergency access if Traefik fails)
- Prometheus: `http://SERVER_IP:9090` (metrics scraping)
- Alertmanager: `http://SERVER_IP:9093` (alert management)
- See [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for complete list

See **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)** for detailed installation instructions.

## üîí SSL Certificates

By default, services use **self-signed certificates** (browser warnings expected). For **trusted Let's Encrypt certificates**, see **[docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ssl-certificate-setup](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ssl-certificate-setup)** for complete setup instructions using `make ssl-setup`.

## üîê Security

This project implements **multi-layered defense-in-depth security** with four protection layers:

### Security Layers

**üî• Layer 1: Network Firewall (UFW)**
- Default deny incoming, SSH rate-limited
- Only WireGuard VPN (51820/UDP) and HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) exposed
- Local network and VPN clients have full access

**üõ°Ô∏è Layer 2: Traefik Middleware**
- **IP Whitelisting**: Admin interfaces only accessible from local network/VPN
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, XSS protection, frame deny
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 req/min for admin, 100 req/min for webhooks

**üö´ Layer 3: Fail2ban**
- Auto-bans IPs after repeated auth failures (3 ‚Üí 1h ban)
- Detects scanning activity (10 x 404 ‚Üí 24h ban)
- Monitors webhook abuse (20 x rate limit ‚Üí 10m ban)

**üìä Layer 4: Prometheus Security Monitoring**
- Real-time alerts for auth failures, scanning, DDoS attempts
- Tracks rate limit enforcement and server errors
- Monitors fail2ban and Traefik availability

### Access Model

- **Admin Interfaces** (n8n, Grafana, etc.): VPN or local network only
- **Future Webhooks**: Public access with rate limiting (not yet configured)
- **VPN Primary Boundary**: WireGuard for all remote admin access

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for security policy and **[security-tickets/README.md](security-tickets/README.md)** for the complete security roadmap.
