## üìã Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd home-server-stack

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Update SERVER_IP, TIMEZONE, passwords

# 3. Run first-time setup (includes all services + monitoring)
# SSL certificates are automatically generated
make setup

# 4. Configure Bookwyrm (one-time)
cd external/bookwyrm-docker
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Configure Bookwyrm settings

# 5. Deploy Bookwyrm
make bookwyrm-setup
```

**Note:**
- SSL certificates are self-signed for local network use
- You'll need to accept security warnings in your browser on first visit
- This is normal and expected for local-only services
- For browsers that don't allow proceeding, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#ssl-certificate-issues)
- The first `make setup` will deploy all core services and monitoring, and clone the Bookwyrm wrapper
- Configure and deploy Bookwyrm separately using `make bookwyrm-setup`

**Using the Makefile:**
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make setup` - First time setup (all services + monitoring)
- `make bookwyrm-setup` - Deploy Bookwyrm (after configuring .env)
- `make update` - Update all services to latest versions
- `make start` - Start all services
- `make stop` - Stop all services
- `make logs` - View logs from all services
- See `make help` for complete list of commands

**Access Services:**

All services are accessible via domain names on your local network:

- **Traefik Dashboard:** `https://traefik.home.local`
- **AdGuard Home:** `https://adguard.home.local` (DNS admin)
- **n8n:** `https://n8n.home.local` (Workflow automation)
- **Glance:** `https://glance.home.local` (Dashboard)
- **HortusFox:** `https://hortusfox.home.local` (Plant management)
- **Habitica:** `https://habitica.home.local` (Habit tracker)
- **Bookwyrm:** `https://bookwyrm.home.local` (Book tracking)
- **Ollama API:** `https://ollama.home.local` (AI models)
- **Grafana:** `https://grafana.home.local` (Monitoring)
- **Prometheus:** `https://prometheus.home.local` (Metrics)
- **Alertmanager:** `https://alerts.home.local` (Alerts)

**Note:** Services are accessible via domain names thanks to Traefik reverse proxy and AdGuard Home DNS. Your devices must use AdGuard Home as their DNS server (configured automatically if DHCP points to the server).

**Direct IP Access:** Some services remain accessible via IP:port for specific operational needs:
- AdGuard Home: `http://SERVER_IP:8888` (emergency access if Traefik fails)
- Ollama API: `http://SERVER_IP:11434` (direct API access for AI workloads)
- Prometheus: `http://SERVER_IP:9090` (metrics scraping)
- Alertmanager: `http://SERVER_IP:9093` (alert management)
- See [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) for complete list

See **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)** for detailed installation instructions.
